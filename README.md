# DotNETwithGPT

DotNETwithGPT is a repository that showcases the integration of the GPT-3.5 language model from OpenAI with .NET applications. It demonstrates how you can leverage the power of natural language processing and generation using GPT-3.5 within your .NET projects.

## Introduction

This repository provides a simple example of utilizing the GPT-3.5 model through the OpenAI GPT API. It demonstrates how to make API calls to generate text using the GPT-3.5 model, showcasing the potential of natural language processing and generating human-like text.

## Getting Started

To get started with DotNETwithGPT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (`DotNETwithGPT.sln`) in your preferred IDE.
3. Set up your OpenAI API credentials by providing your API key in the `OpenAIService.cs` file.
4. Build and run the project to execute the provided example code.

## Example Usage

The repository includes a sample code file, `Program.cs`, that demonstrates how to interact with the GPT-3.5 model. It showcases how to make API requests to generate text using the OpenAI GPT API.

You can modify the provided code to suit your specific use cases and experiment with different prompts and configurations to generate text tailored to your needs.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following NuGet packages:

- `OpenAI`: Provides a client library for accessing the OpenAI GPT API.

Make sure to install the required NuGet packages before running the project.

## Configuration

To use the OpenAI GPT API, you need to provide your API key in the `OpenAIService.cs` file. Replace the placeholder value with your own API key:

```csharp
private const string ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

Make sure to keep your API key secure and avoid committing it to version control systems.
